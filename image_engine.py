"""Image generation engines for the Agentic Flows planner.

The director-collaboration loop:

  1. Agent plans a multi-shot piece in plain text.
  2. Agent calls `generate_shot_images(shot_label, prompt, n=4)` per shot.
     Each call returns a list of candidate PNGs saved on disk.
  3. UI renders the candidates as a thumbnail grid in the tool-result
     card. User clicks the best one — that POSTs to
     `/agent/sessions/<id>/anchors/select` which records the choice in
     `session.tool_state["selected_anchors"]`.
  4. User types "render". Agent reads the selected anchors and submits
     i2v shots with each anchor as `ref_image_path`. The video model
     fills the motion between known frames; the look is locked.

This module is the dispatch layer. Four backends ship today:

  - **mock** — flat-colored PNGs drawn with PIL. Zero deps beyond what
    LTX already needs. Used for testing the UX without spending API
    credits and as a fallback when no API key is set.
  - **bfl**  — Black Forest Labs (api.bfl.ml). Async submit + poll.
    Requires `bfl_api_key`. Models: flux-dev (cheap, 25 steps),
    flux-pro (better, slower), flux-schnell (4 steps, fastest).
  - **mflux** — fully-local Mac generation via filipstrand/mflux. Now
    multi-family: mflux 0.17.x ships per-family CLI commands
    (`mflux-generate-flux2`, `mflux-generate-z-image-turbo`,
    `mflux-generate-fibo`, `mflux-generate-qwen`, `mflux-generate-kontext`)
    in addition to the legacy `mflux-generate` (flux1-only). We auto-detect
    the family from the model id and call the right binary, with
    per-family step / guidance defaults so users who just pick a model
    don't have to know it needs 4 steps vs 25.
  - **hidream** — fully-local HiDream-O1-Image-Dev (8B Qwen3-VL-based unified
    pixel-patch transformer, MIT). Lives in its own venv outside Phosphene
    at ``$HIDREAM_LAB_DIR`` (defaults to ``~/HIDREAM-O1-MLX-LAB-active``).
    Subprocess pattern, mirrors
    mflux. Default **BF16** (~16 GB working set, 1024×1024 in ~67s) —
    matches upstream's master-weight precision and is the only precision
    that doesn't show patch-grid artifacts in flat regions. Q8/Q6 work
    at square 2048×2048 but exhibit visible 32-px grid artifacts at
    non-square trained dims. Q4 ships dark (brightness collapse).
    **Supports HiDream's native edit + multi-ref**: K=1 instruction edits
    ("change the white jacket to red") preserve scene+pose+identity;
    K=2-3 subject-driven personalization composes multiple references
    into a new scene. Edit requires BF16 (quant breaks ref attention).

  Recommended defaults (May 2026):
    - **Comfortable+ (32 GB+)**  → `Runpod/FLUX.2-klein-4B-mflux-4bit`
      via `mflux-generate-flux2`, 4 steps, guidance 1.0. Apache 2.0,
      ~4.3 GB on disk, 4 candidates per shot in 50-75 s.
    - **Compact (16-32 GB)**     → `filipstrand/Z-Image-Turbo-mflux-4bit`
      via `mflux-generate-z-image-turbo`, 9 steps, guidance 0.0.
      Apache 2.0, ~5.9 GB on disk.

tier-aware default table.

    """Subprocess the right `mflux-generate-*` binary ONCE for all `n` seeds.

    Pre-2026-05-08 this spawned one subprocess per candidate, paying the
    ~30-60 s model-load cost N times. mflux's per-family CLIs already
    loop internally over `args.seed`, loading the model exactly once
    and looping over `for seed in args.seed: image = qwen.generate_image(...)`.
    By passing every seed in a single invocation and using mflux's
    `{seed}` template in `--output`, we drop wall-time on n=4 batches
    from "4 × (load + gen)" to "1 × load + 4 × gen", which is a
    3-4× speedup on Lightning configs and a 1.3-1.6× speedup on
    raw 8-step Q4. Bigger when generation itself is fast (load dominates).

    Family is inferred from `config.mflux_model` (or taken from
    `config.mflux_family` when set). FLUX.1 / FLUX.2 / Z-Image /
    Z-Image-Turbo / FIBO / Qwen / Qwen-Edit / Kontext each have their
    dedicated CLI from mflux 0.17.x.

    `config.mflux_lora_paths` + `config.mflux_lora_scales` plumb through
    to `--lora-paths` and `--lora-scales`. The intended use is a
    Lightning LoRA on qwen_edit:
      mflux_lora_paths = ["lightx2v/Qwen-Image-Edit-2511-Lightning"]
      mflux_lora_scales = [1.0]
      mflux_steps = 4
    which lands at ~10-15 s/image vs ~5 min for raw 30-step gen.

    Recommended defaults (May 2026):
      - **Qwen-Image-Edit-2509** — Apache 2.0, multi-ref. Iteration:
        Q4 + 8 steps, ~1 min/image. Final: Q8 + 30 steps, ~5 min.
      - **FLUX.2 [klein] 4B 4-bit** — Apache 2.0, 4 steps, ~4.3 GB.
      - **Z-Image-Turbo 4-bit** — Apache 2.0, 9 steps, ~5.9 GB.

    First run downloads weights (4-34 GB depending on family) to
    ~/.cache/huggingface. Subsequent calls use the cached copy.
