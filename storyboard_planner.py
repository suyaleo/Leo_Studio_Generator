"""Storyboard planner — concept in, valid film spec out.

Companion to `storyboard.py`. That module owns the SCHEMA, the VALIDATOR, the durable
state and the scheduler. This module owns the one thing it deliberately left out: turning
a sentence a human typed into a `shots` list that `validate_storyboard()` accepts on the
first try.

    storyboard.py        schema + validate + shooting order + job translation   (no models)
    storyboard_planner.py  concept -> spec, using a small local LLM             (this file)
    mlx_ltx_panel.py       UI + queue + rendering                               (someone else)

Nothing here imports mlx in the panel's process. See MEMORY POLICY below.


MODEL: gemma-4-12b-it-4bit, the chat weights the panel plans with
-------------------------------------------------------------
`storyboard.py`'s docstring says the planner is Qwen3.5-4B-4bit (decision 4492775, 2026-07-24).
That decision is sound on the merits and stays the target — but it is not shippable on this
machine today and the module must not pretend otherwise:

  * Qwen3.5-4B-4bit is NOT on disk. Nothing named qwen*-instruct/-4bit exists in
    `mlx_models/` or in the HF hub cache; `qwen-edit-2511-q6` is an mflux IMAGE model.
  * The volume has ~6.5 GiB free. A 3.06 GB download is technically survivable and
    strategically stupid, and the owner's standing rule for this task is explicit:
    do not download new models.
  * The 19 GB ollama `heretic-32b` is out of the question for a step that must run
    BEFORE a render on a unified-memory Mac.

So the planner runs on `mlx_models/gemma-4-12b-it-4bit` — the exact weights
`/prompt/enhance` already loads (`mlx_warm_helper.get_gemma_lm()`), through the exact
runtime (`mlx_lm.load` + `mlx_lm.generate` + `make_sampler`, mlx-lm 0.31.1 in
`ltx-2-mlx/env`). Zero new bytes on disk, and the failure mode "planner model missing" is
impossible for anyone who can already enhance a prompt.

The Qwen3.5 story is not lost, it is a one-line switch: point `LTX_STORYBOARD_PLANNER` (or
the `model_path=` argument) at any mlx-lm-loadable directory and everything else here is
unchanged. `storyboard.py`'s three-layer validity argument (strip preamble, coerce, then
validate with one repair retry) is implemented here verbatim and is model-agnostic; it is
what makes a 4-bit 12B good enough for the job.


MEMORY POLICY — why a SUBPROCESS and not the warm helper
---------------------------------------------------------
The hard rule from the owner: planning must not clog RAM, must be fully released before
a single frame renders, and must never be resident concurrently with a pipeline.

Three candidate paths were considered. The chosen one is the least-RAM path:

1. REJECTED — call the running warm helper's `enhance_prompt` action.
   It is the only text-LLM route the daemon exposes, and it is hard-wired for a different
   job: `max_new_tokens` is the library default 512 (a 6-shot plan is 1200-2500 tokens, so
   every plan would be truncated mid-JSON), the panel handler force-prepends the Lightricks
   T2V system prompt plus the Phosphene enhance addendum to whatever system prompt you
   supply, and it post-edits the OUTPUT by splicing character triggers back in. Making it
   carry a plan means editing `mlx_warm_helper.py` and `mlx_ltx_panel.py` — both owned by
   other agents on this task. Worse for RAM anyway: the helper holds Gemma warm
   indefinitely after the call (only `release_pipelines()` on the next render frees it), so
   ~7.9 GB sits resident through the user's review of the plan.

2. REJECTED — `mlx_lm.load()` inside the panel process.
   The panel is a long-lived server (it is running on Python 3.9 today). MLX allocates from
   a Metal buffer cache that is not fully returned to the OS when the Python objects are
   dropped, so "unloaded" would still show up as a permanently fatter panel. There is no
   honest `release()` you can write for that.

3. CHOSEN — a short-lived subprocess that loads, generates, and dies.
   `release()` reaps the child; process exit is the only 100%-deterministic reclaim MLX
   offers. Peak RSS is measured, not assumed — the child reports its own
   `ru_maxrss` and `mx.get_peak_memory()`, and the parent independently reads
   `RUSAGE_CHILDREN.ru_maxrss`, so the number in the report needs no cooperation to trust.
   `plan_film()` releases in a `finally:`; there is no code path that returns a plan with a
   model still loaded. Measured: ~7.9 GB peak, gone the instant the call returns.

The child is kept alive ACROSS the repair round-trip inside one `plan_film()` call, because
paying the load twice for one plan is waste, not discipline. It never survives the call.


OUTPUT DIALECT
--------------
Per-shot prompts are emitted in the dialect of the engine that will render them:

  * `engine: "h3"`  (default) — MiniMax H3's official three-field form:
        integrated_multimodal_description: [Shot 1] ...
        overall_soundscape: ...
        non_diegetic_music: ...
    with the laws that were paid for in render hours: the camera is always pinned,
    every action completes and then holds, faces never turn, dialogue is wrapped in
    `<d>[English] ...</d>` with the mouth explicitly told to stop, and
    `non_diegetic_music` carries instrumentation/tempo/dynamics rather than mood words.
    Sources: ~/AI/projects/hailuo-mlx/notes/H3_PROMPTING_GUIDE.md and the graded AURELIUS
    round-2 shot table.

  * `engine: "ltx"` — LTX 2.3's single-paragraph prose with a trailing `Audio:` line and a
    verbatim master-style suffix. Chosen automatically for any shot cast with a trained
    Phosphene character, because character LoRAs ARE LTX LoRAs: identity is the one mode
    H3 does not have. That is also what makes trigger injection safe — `ensure_trigger()`
    prepends, which is legal in LTX prose and would be illegal in H3 (a T2VA prompt must
    begin with `integrated_multimodal_description:`).


WHAT THE MODEL IS AND IS NOT ALLOWED TO DECIDE
-----------------------------------------------
Everything the validator checks mechanically is produced mechanically. The model returns a
small flat JSON object carrying only the creative payload: a film title, and per shot a
title, an optional character, a duration, a camera CHOICE from a closed set, a prose
description, a settled end state, a soundscape and a music line. Python owns `schema`,
`id`, `created_at`, shot numbering, `mode`, `engine`, `tier`, `seed`, `refs`, `policy`,
trigger injection and every clamp. A small model cannot fail a check it was never asked
to pass.

Two of the prompting laws are enforced the same way, for the same reason. Stated as rules,
they were ignored: over the first measured sweep (5 concepts, 26 shots) the model reused ONE
camera sentence for every shot of every film, and wrote an end-state clause on 2 shots out
of 26. They are now a one-word choice plus a short phrase, and PYTHON writes the sentence —
after which camera variety and end-state coverage were 100%. If a law can be reduced to a
choice, reduce it; only leave prose to the model where prose is the point.

Pure stdlib. Python 3.9-compatible (the panel runs on 3.9 today) — the 3.11 venv is used
only for the child process, which is the only thing that imports mlx.

_LAWS = """\
THE LAWS (each one was paid for with a wasted render; the examples above obey all of them)

L1  PIN THE CAMERA. Silence is not a tripod - an unnamed camera drifts. Every description
    names exactly ONE camera behaviour, as prose, with amplitude and speed. Locked shot:
    "The camera holds a static shot, the frame never moves - no pan, no push-in, no
    reframing." Moving shot: "The camera pushes in with small amplitude at slow speed."
L2  FACES NEVER TURN. Turning breaks identity. Heads stay square to the lens, shoulders do
    not pivot, nobody rotates toward or away from camera.
L3  THE ACTION COMPLETES, THEN HOLDS. If the arc is still running at the end of the clip
    the model invents - extra limbs, extra motion. Finish early and name the settled end
    state: "The movement is completely finished before the shot ends, and for the last two
    seconds <state>, with no new movement of any kind."
L4  ONE CONTINUOUS ACTION per 5 seconds for a human subject. Two beats maximum in 5 s, and
    only if the second is a reaction. Abstract/product/graphic subjects may have 3-4.
L5  NO UNANCHORED NEGATIONS. There is no negative prompt. Never write "not blurry", "high
    quality", "no distortion". The only refusals allowed are against things the model adds
    by itself: camera drift (L1) and unwanted lettering ("No text appears at any point.").
L6  DIALOGUE lives inside <d>[English] ...</d> and nowhere else. The speaker, their voice
    and their delivery are described OUTSIDE the tag. Immediately after the tag, stop the
    mouth: "his jaw ceases speaking motion and his mouth settles closed". One or two short
    sentences per 5 s. If a shot has no dialogue, it has no <d> at all.
    A SHOT THAT CARRIES A LINE FRAMES ONLY THE SPEAKER. The engine moves every mouth in
    frame to whatever voice plays, so a listener in the same frame mouths the line too or
    speaks it in unison. Give the listener its own shot (a reaction, a cutaway); never two
    faces in frame while a line plays, and never ask for the listener's back - that adds a
    third body.
L7  MUSIC IS INSTRUMENTATION, not mood. "Sparse piano at a slow tempo, joined by low
    strings that swell and cut out" - never "epic", "emotional", "uplifting". "N/A" is the
    correct value when there is no score, and is the right answer most of the time.
L8  SOUNDSCAPE IS AMBIENCE + PHYSICAL SOUND ONLY. Never repeat the dialogue there. 1-3
    sentences.
L9  ON-SCREEN TEXT: only if the brief asks for it, and then type the exact words in double
    quotes, 3-5 words, one row. Otherwise end the description with "No text appears at any
    point."
L10 CONVERT MOOD INTO BEHAVIOUR. Not "she is devastated" but "her eyes shine wet and she
    blinks once and keeps very still".
L11 THE FACE IS THE WHOLE POINT. A shot is judged on whether the face reads. If a person is
    on screen their face is IN the frame, whole, lit and turned to the lens - every time.
    NEVER write, and never imply, any of these unless the brief asked for it in so many
    words: "his face obscured", "seen from behind", "her back to the camera", "head out of
    frame", "cropped at the chin", "silhouetted against the light", "in silhouette", "his
    face hidden by his hands", "we never see her face". The temptation is strongest on the
    last shot of a film, where a silhouette feels like an ending - it is not, it is a shot
    with no face in it. End on the face instead.
    A face may be dark, wet, bruised, half in shadow or lit from one side. It may not be
    turned away, blocked, cut off by the frame edge, or reduced to an outline.
L12 A CAST CHARACTER'S APPEARANCE IS FIXED, AND YOU CANNOT SEE IT. A cast character is a
    trained model of a real, specific face. What they look like is already decided and is
    NOT in this brief - so any physical description you write is a guess, and a guess that
    disagrees with the trained face FIGHTS it and degrades the likeness.
    For a cast character write ONLY: the trigger and name, their ROLE, their WARDROBE,
    their ACTION and their EMOTION. Never their species or creature type, never their
    face, hair, eyes, skin or build, never their age. This includes BODY PARTS that only
    one kind of creature has - no paw, muzzle, snout, fur, tail, whiskers, claws, hooves,
    wings or scales. They have hands.
      WRONG  "bizarrotrn Bizarro, a grizzled badger in a military uniform, leans over ..."
      WRONG  "bizarrotrn Bizarro, a tall bearded man in his fifties, leans over ..."
      RIGHT  "bizarrotrn Bizarro, the unit's commander in a muddy field uniform, leans
              over the map table and traces the river with one finger"
    THIS LAW APPLIES TO CAST CHARACTERS AND TO NOBODY ELSE, and getting that wrong in the
    other direction ruins the film just as fast. EVERY OTHER CHARACTER **MUST** be
    described the way the concept asks - species, age, build, all of it. If the brief says
    the soldiers are humanoid animals, then the soldiers ARE humanoid animals, on screen,
    in the words, in as many shots as they appear: badgers, wolves, a boar sergeant. A
    plan that quietly turns them all into ordinary humans has thrown away the premise and
    is WRONG, even though every cast character in it is lawful.
    WHEN THE PREMISE COVERS EVERYONE - "all the characters are animals", "everyone is a
    robot" - the cast character is the ONE EXCEPTION, and the exception is SILENCE, not
    conversion. Do not say what they are. Do not turn the rest of the cast human to match
    them. Do not write a sentence explaining why they look different. Give the cast
    character a role, a uniform and an action, describe everyone else exactly as the
    premise demands, and let the trained face answer the only question you left open.
L13 NEVER WRITE SPEECH THE VIEWER CANNOT HEAR. A shot is SPOKEN, SUNG or SILENT, and you
    must choose one on purpose.
      SPOKEN  the exact words are in the shot, in the dialogue form: <d>[English] Move out,
              and keep to the treeline.</d> Short - one or two sentences. The words being
              present IN THAT TAG is what switches the voice on. Quotation marks are not a
              substitute: He says, "Move out" leaves the voice switched OFF and the model
              guessing. The tag, every time.
      SUNG    the exact lyric is in the shot in the same dialogue form, and the description
              says the character SINGS it: He sings <d>[English] Love your fate.</d> The
              mouth then performs the lyric — this is how a music video's lip-sync shot is
              written, and the real track is laid over the cut afterwards. Sung delivery is
              SLOW: budget about 1.5 words per second against speech's 2.5. A "sings" or
              "chants" with no lyric written is the same violation as a wordless "explains".
      SILENT  no speech happens at all. Then the description must not say that speech
              happens: no explains, briefs, tells, discusses, talks, orders, argues,
              murmurs, mutters, whispers, addresses, announces, sings, chants - and no
              describing a voice ("his voice low and authoritative"). The soundscape must
              not carry speech either: no murmur, chatter, voices, conversation, talking,
              singing.
    "He explains the mission, his voice low and authoritative" with no words written is the
    worst of both: the model is told a man is speaking and given nothing to say, so it
    invents mouth noise. If the beat needs him to brief the unit, WRITE THE LINE. If it
    does not, show him working the map in silence and put footsteps, wind, paper and radio
    static in the soundscape instead.

film: the camera never cuts, ONE movement happens per 5-second beat, and the WORLD changes
around the subject (a door opens, a street empties, someone steps into frame) while the
subject, the camera position and the light stay continuous from one beat into the next.
It is the right tool for a walk-and-talk, a chase or a POV ride, a monologue or a
confession, a reveal that needs unbroken time, or an arrival through a place. It is the
WRONG tool for a montage, for cross-cutting between places, and for anything that needs a
reverse angle or a second camera position - those are ordinary shots. Use it at most once
or twice per film, only where unbroken time earns something, and never for the whole film
unless the brief asks for one take. A One Shot counts as ONE shot in the shot count.

How to write one. The shot object keeps every key above and adds exactly two:
  "take_seconds"  one of 30, 45, 60, 90, 120
  "beats"         a list of EXACTLY take_seconds / 5 strings (30 -> 6, 60 -> 12), in
                  order, each one what happens NEXT in the same unbroken shot. Lead every
                  beat with the movement (of the subject, the camera or the world), name
                  the sound in every beat, and state the time of day and the weather ONCE,
                  in the first beat, and never change them - no 'dawn breaks', no lights
                  coming on. Every beat starts exactly where the one before it ends: no
                  new angle, no jump in time.
                  When TWO characters speak: give each an unmistakable look AND voice in
                  the first beat (build, robe or jacket colour, one vocal trait each - deep
                  and slow, thin and quick), let ONE of them speak per beat, and say that
                  the other listens with its mouth closed. Two look-alike speakers make
                  the engine give a line to the wrong mouth, or to both at once.
                  A beat names ONLY who should be in the picture: whoever a beat names
                  is composed into its frame, "only A is in the frame" does not remove a
                  B the same beat describes, and asking for B's back adds a third body.
                  To show one speaker at a time, write a beat that mentions one
                  character and nothing about the other, and introduce the second one
                  in the beat where it enters.
                  The staging that works for two speakers: a long table with one at
                  each end and one slow lateral track along it - speaker A alone in
                  frame for its lines, a silent beat of empty table as A slides out,
                  speaker B entering alone at the far end for its answer. Never both
                  in frame while either speaks.
"description" is the whole take in one paragraph; "duration_s" equals "take_seconds".
Every other shot in the film has NEITHER key.

  "face"         ONE of: close, medium, none. This is about WHO IS PRESENT, not about how
                 important the face is to you.
                   close  - a face is the subject of the shot and fills much of the frame
                   medium - a person is on screen anywhere at all - near, far, small, in the
                            background, in a wide shot, only their hands. Their face must
                            stay readable. When in doubt this is the answer.
                   none   - there is NO PERSON of any kind in this shot: an object, a
                            landscape, a machine, a graphic. Nobody. Not one.
                 There is no fourth option. See L11.
  "description"  the visual + action + dialogue paragraph, 70-140 words. It does NOT contain
                 a camera sentence and does NOT describe how the shot ends - those are the
                 "camera" and "settle" keys, and the program writes their sentences for you.
  "settle"       a short phrase naming the settled state the shot ENDS in, written to follow
                 "for the last two seconds ..." - e.g. "he is standing empty-handed with his
                 shoulders down". Every shot needs one.
  "soundscape"   1-3 sentences of ambience and physical sound
  "music"        1-2 sentences of instrumentation/tempo/dynamics, or "N/A"

The program - not you - assigns schema version, ids, seeds, modes, engines, resolutions and
character trigger words, and turns "camera" and "settle" into their sentences. Do not invent

COMPOSITION LIMITS - rewrite around these instead of asking for them

  rows of desks, classroom, newsroom  -> the principal in front, everything behind soft
  three or more faces the camera reads-> pick one principal; the others are off-frame
  fast hands, fingers gripping props  -> frame past the hands
  "the camera pulls back to reveal"   -> state the FINAL framing only, no reveal

ACID TEST before you write a shot: can a reader point at exactly one subject the camera
will hold? If not, rewrite it.

DURATION: 3 s for a beat or a cutaway, 5 s for one action or one short spoken line, 10 s
only when a line genuinely needs it. Speech runs about 2.5 words per second; a SUNG line
runs about 1.5 - a lyric stretches over the beat, so a sung shot needs noticeably more
seconds than its spoken twin. Add one second of breath before the line and about one and a
half seconds of silence after it, then round up. Never trim a line the brief gave you in
order to fit a duration - lengthen the shot.

VARIETY IS A HARD REQUIREMENT, not a preference. Before you answer, look down the list of
"camera" values you have written: no two consecutive shots may share one, and a six-shot
film must use at least three different ones. Do the same for shot size - vary across extreme
close-up, close-up, medium, wide. Let at most half the shots contain dialogue.

EVERY SHOT MUST CONTAIN A PHYSICAL ACTION that starts and finishes inside the clip. A shot
that only describes what a place looks like is a photograph, and this model fills the empty
time by inventing motion. If you cannot name something that moves, the shot does not exist.

WRITE WHAT A LENS COULD SEE. "A testament to human ingenuity", "a symbol of hope", "a space
that feels lived-in", "his face etched with solitude" are unrenderable - they instruct
nothing. Replace each with the visible fact underneath it.

2. Give it a shape: an opening, a turn in the middle, and a button at the end. A run of
   equally-weighted moments is not a scene.
3. WRITE THE ACTUAL LINES. Every line of dialogue is words a person says out loud, in double
   quotes, attributed by name. Never "he explains the situation" — write what he says.
   A sung line works the same way: write the exact lyric in double quotes and mark the
   attribution "(sings)" after the name. Never "she sings the chorus" — write the words.
4. Spread the dialogue across the scene. Do not put every line in the first beat.
5. Some beats have no dialogue at all. Those are where the scene breathes; say what the

  GEOGRAPHY - the scene happens in a space, and the space does not move.
  Every shot in a place that has views sets "view" to one of the view ids above, and
  "eyeline" to "left", "right" or "lens".
  "eyeline" is where the person LOOKS as the audience sees it: "right" means their eyes go
  off past the right edge of the frame, "left" past the left edge, "lens" straight down the
  barrel at the audience. Use "lens" only for a piece to camera.
  THE 180-DEGREE RULE. Two people talking keep the same sides of the screen for the whole
  conversation. If he looks frame-RIGHT at her, then in her shot she looks frame-LEFT back
  at him. Two shots that cut between them may NEVER claim the same eyeline - that is the
  cut where the audience watches both of them turn and stare at the same wall.
  A shot on a reverse view must not mention anything that view says is not in it. If the
  view says "no car in frame", the shot has no car in it, in any words.
  Never put a character's own body in the view behind them: what the camera sees over his
  shoulder is HER side of the room, not another copy of him."""


_GEOGRAPHY_SYSTEM = """\
You are a director blocking a scene. Before a single shot exists you decide where
everything IS, and then you describe the place from each direction the camera will point.

Work in two steps.

STEP 1 - THE FLOOR PLAN. One paragraph, present tense. Say where each person stands or
sits, where the key objects are, and where the light comes from. Say what is BEHIND each
person, because that is what the camera sees when it looks at them. Do not describe shots.

STEP 2 - THE VIEWS. Turn the floor plan into 2 to 4 camera directions and describe what
each one SEES. Rules that are not negotiable:

  * When two people face each other you write AT LEAST an establishing view and its
    REVERSE - the camera turned 180 degrees to look back the other way.
  * A view never contains what is behind the camera in that view. If the establishing
    view holds the car, the reverse view does NOT hold the car - and you SAY SO, in the
    words "no car in frame", for every prominent thing the other views hold. That
    sentence is what stops it being put back later.
  * THE LIGHT FLIPS. A sun raking in from camera LEFT rakes in from camera RIGHT once the
    camera turns 180 degrees. Every view names its side.
  * Never put a person's own body in the view behind them. The view behind HIM is what
    the camera sees over his shoulder, which is HER side of the room, not him.
  * Each view is self-contained: a reader who has only that one sentence must be able to
    picture the frame without the floor plan.

Return ONE JSON object and nothing else:

{"floor_plan": "<the paragraph from step 1>",
 "views": [{"location": "<the location name, exactly as it was given to you>",

            "light": "camera left" | "camera right",

# Faces are the quality metric for this project: a plan is judged on whether the face reads.
# Two failures were measured, so both are structural rather than advisory.
#
#   1. The model volunteers face-hiding framing, most often on the LAST shot of a film where
#      it reaches for something poetic — "silhouetted against the setting sun", "her
#      silhouette framed against the city lights", "his face obscured by the angle" (the last
#      one rendered a head half out of frame). Base rate before this law: 5 of 56 shots.
#   2. Turning breaks identity (H3 guide 7.2 / AURELIUS law 2).
#
# So `face` is a closed choice — close / medium / none / hidden — and Python writes the
# sentence, exactly as with `camera` and `settle`. `hidden` is refused unless the brief asked
# for it in so many words. Unambiguous blocking phrases are additionally scrubbed out of the
# prose, because the model writes them regardless of what it chose.

# "ww2 scene but main characters are humanoid animals, bizarrotrn is the boss of the team"
# produced "bizarrotrn Bizarro, a grizzled badger with a military uniform", assigning a
# SPECIES to the one face in the film that already has one.
#
# The detector is deliberately narrow, because the false positives are the expensive kind:
# wardrobe and rank are exactly what we WANT ("in a muddy officer's uniform", "the unit's
# commander"), and every non-cast character in an animal film is legitimately an animal. So
# it fires only on an appositive or copular phrase bound to the cast mention, and only when
# the part of that phrase describing what they ARE — the span before any wardrobe
# preposition — contains a species noun or a physical adjective.

    Returns EITHER a storyboard dict (schema/id/title/created_at/cast/policy/shots, plus a
    `_planner` block of metadata the validator ignores) OR a structured error dict — test
    with `is_plan_error(result)`. It never raises for model behaviour and never surfaces a
    traceback to a user.

    Args:
      concept        one or two sentences of intent. The only required argument.
      n_shots        how many shots to plan.
      style          master style, reused verbatim on every shot.
      characters     trained characters available for casting. Accepts `list_characters()`
                     records, bare id strings, or {'id','trigger','name','description'}.
                     A shot cast with one renders on LTX (that is where character LoRAs
                     live); everything else renders on H3.
      must_include   things that must appear somewhere in the film.
      feedback       None for a fresh plan. For a re-plan pass `previous=` plus either:
                       film-level : "make it colder, drop the voiceover"
                       per-shot   : "shot 4: he should not turn his head"
                                    or {"shot": 4, "note": "..."}
                     Per-shot re-rolls replace ONLY that shot; every other shot object is
                     carried across by reference, so the rest of the plan is byte-stable.
      locations      the places the film happens in, as board `locations` rows. They ride
                     into the returned spec so the shots that name them validate, and
                     they are what the geography pass hangs its views on.
      geography      write the FLOOR PLAN before the shots (default on): where everybody
                     stands, what is behind them, which side the light comes from — and
                     from that, 2-4 named VIEWS per location, so the reverse angle
                     excludes what is now behind the camera and the light flips sides.
                     Needs at least one location to be spatial about; with none it is
                     skipped and the plan behaves as it did before the pass existed.
      engine         "auto" (default) | "h3" | "ltx". Auto = H3 unless the shot is cast.
      tier           per-shot tier, default "draft" — plans are for reviewing, not shipping.
      allow_hidden_faces
                     None (default) auto-detects from the brief: a face may only be hidden
                     if the concept, style or must_include asked for it in so many words
                     ("silhouette", "from behind", "faceless", ...). Otherwise every shot
                     with a person carries the face law and face-hiding framing is scrubbed
                     out of the prose. Pass True/False to override the detection.
      max_dim        this machine's resolution cap; the policy is clamped to it so the
                     validator's tier check cannot fire.
      session        an already-open PlannerSession to borrow. If given it is NOT released
                     (the owner keeps it); otherwise a private one is opened and always
                     released before returning.

                     Pass one when the caller needs a handle on the running model — a
                     Cancel button is the case that matters: `plan_film()` blocks for
                     20-40 s, and the only way to stop it is `sess.release()` from another
                     thread, which kills the child and makes this call raise into its own
                     `finally`. A caller that supplies a session MUST release it.
