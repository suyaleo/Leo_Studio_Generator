// ===========================================================================
// THE TIMELINE — the client half of /storyboard/edit
// ===========================================================================
//
// The shot list is INTENT: what the film should contain, one card per thing to
// render. This is ARRANGEMENT: what plays, from which second of which file, at
// which second of the film. Two documents on disk for the reason
// storyboard_editor.py gives — the moment one shot is used twice, or one is
// split in half, they are different shapes forever.
//
// THREE MEASURED FACTS SHAPE EVERY DECISION BELOW.
//
//  1. A source clip is a single GOP: 235 ms median to seek in Chrome, 1266 ms
//     p90. The all-intra proxy seeks in 3.5 ms. So the preview NEVER points at
//     clip.path when clip.proxy exists, and the one place it may (no proxy yet)
//     says so on the badge instead of pretending.
//
//  2. Two <video> elements measured NO benefit over one once proxies are in
//     play — the swap costs what the seek costs, and two decoders is two
//     decoders. There is one video element here, deliberately.
//
//  3. The preview freezes 50-67 ms at each cut (1.2-1.6 frames at 24 fps) and
//     Safari's seeking is accurate to 3-6 frames. That is stated once, quietly,
//     under the transport, and never papered over: the render is exact, the
//     preview is an approximation of it.
//
// Two traps this feature already paid for, both load-bearing: `muted` is set
// BEFORE the first play() or Chrome silently refuses autoplay, and elements are
// hidden with opacity, never display:none, or WebKit will not load them.

// ---- HOW TALL THE TIMELINE IS, AND WHERE THE HEIGHT GOES ----------------
// Declared HERE rather than with the other SBE_* constants below, because
// SBE's own initialiser reads the stored preference through them and a `const`
// three hundred lines further down is a temporal dead zone, not a value.
//
// The timeline box is a ruler, four lanes, a scrollbar gutter and two borders.
// Only the lanes grow.
const SBE_TL_CHROME = 32;        // 18 ruler + 12 scrollbar gutter + 2 border
// THE LANES, in the order they are on screen. `base` is the floor each one has
// always had, `cap` is the point past which more height stops buying anything,
// and `share` is what fraction of every dragged pixel it takes.
//
// DISTRIBUTED BY SHARE, NOT PROPORTIONAL TO WHAT IS THERE. Proportional
// scaling would hand the picture track 41% of the drag (78 of the 188px of
// lane) and the sound strip 14% — the exact opposite of the reason the handle
// was asked for. 70% of every pixel goes to the two SOUND lanes instead, so
// 100px of drag turns a 26px strip into ~68px: the level line's usable band
// more than triples and a keyframe becomes a target rather than a rumour. The
// ruler takes none of it — a ruler is not more legible for being taller.
//
// REBALANCED 2026-08-20, after the owner used it: "the squares for the video
// design, like the video in the timeline, are expanded too much; they are too
// big. They don't need to be this big." A picture block is a LABEL WITH A
// THUMBNAIL HINT — a name, a timecode, and enough of the frame behind them to
// tell two shots apart. It is not a poster: the frame it stands for is already
// on the program monitor, full size, two inches above. So the picture lane's
// base drops 78 -> 64 (a 52px block: name row, meta row, and a band of picture)
// and its ceiling 240 -> 120, which is the tallest a block can be and still
// read as a block. Both ends were checked on screen.
//
// The height it gave up went to the sound, and so does the drag: the picture's
// share falls 0.22 -> 0.14 and the two sound lanes rise to 0.78 of every
// dragged pixel. The bases rise too — 26 -> 44 on the clip strip and 54 -> 72
// on the soundtrack — because the level line has to be legible AT REST, not
// only after somebody has discovered the handle and pulled it.
const SBE_LANES = [
  { key: 'ov',    base: 32, cap:  56, share: 0.08 },   // overlay: a card is placed, not performed
  { key: 'track', base: 64, cap: 120, share: 0.14 },   // the picture: a labelled block, not a poster
  // THE SOUND LANES CARRY A SECOND HEIGHT — `small`. The owner cuts with clip
  // sound on two lanes and four audio tracks, and every one of them is paid
  // for out of the PICTURE: "the sound expands lower. The picture is so tiny…
  // I cannot see anything in the image, and I can also not push it down."
  // `small` is what a sound lane is worth when nobody is working on sound: a
  // strip tall enough to show WHERE the sound sits and what colour it is, and
  // deliberately too short to edit in — which is the point, because the moment
  // you touch one they come back. `audio: true` is what makes a lane part of
  // that area; A3, A4, … are drawn at `alane`'s height, so they follow it.
  { key: 'alane', base: 44, cap: 190, share: 0.44, audio: true, small: 18 },
  // The soundtrack. Its base rose 72 -> 108 when the bed stopped being a
  // rectangle you can only slide: it now carries a waveform, a level line,
  // draggable points and two corner fade handles, exactly like the strip lane
  // above it — and that lane's base rose 26 -> 44 for the same reason, which
  // is that a control has to be legible AT REST and not only after somebody
  // has discovered it. The HEAD grew with it (the level and the duck now live
  // there), and head and lane read the same variable on purpose.
  { key: 'wave',  base: 108, cap: 240, share: 0.34, audio: true, small: 20 },
];
// Both ends are the SUM of the parts, never a hand-picked round number — the
// floor is every lane at its base (which is what the box needs to draw itself
// without clipping) and the ceiling is every lane at its cap (past which the
// drag would be buying dead band). `test_the_height_floor_is_the_sum_of_its
// _lanes` asserts exactly that, because the 190 this replaced was itemised in
// a comment and the overlay lane was added without moving it: the box has
// been 30px short of its own contents, with `overflow-y: hidden` over the
// difference, since that lane shipped.
// ...and both ends MOVE WITH THE SOUND AREA. A constant floor is exactly what
// stopped the owner compacting his timeline — "I can also not push it down if
// I want to compact it" — because 280 was the sum of the lanes at their FULL
// height and the handle could never ask for less than every lane's base. With
// the sound lanes small the box's own contents are 114px shorter, so that is
// how much further down the handle goes, and sbeFitMonitors hands every one of
// those pixels (plus the second clip lane's and every track's) to the monitors.

// A MIRROR IS A THING THAT DRIFTS, so the browser is what catches it, not a

// px/round(px) CSS pixels and the clip lands up to half a pixel off. Measured
// without it: the target's left edge came back at 471.84 against a handle

// gesture was double-click-to-add, drag-to-set, shift-click-to-remove: three
// things knowable only by being told.
//
// Everything that reads or writes a level now goes through this pair, because
// three gestures were each carrying their own copy of the arithmetic and two
// of them had already drifted onto a hard-coded 20px band. `sbeStripY` and
// `sbeStripGain` are exact inverses at every strip height — there is a test
// that round-trips them at five of them.
// HEADROOM, AND IT IS THE WHOLE OF WHY THE LINE IS DRAGGABLE. "You are able to
// drag the sound thingy, but it's not super user-friendly. Maybe you should put
// the orange line a little lower so it feels more draggable." At 1px, unity was
// drawn ON the strip's own top edge: the target is a 14px stroke centred on the
// line, so six of its seven upper pixels fell outside the strip and were
// clipped away by the SVG viewport, leaving a one-sided sliver to aim at that
// also competed with the lane's border.
//
// EIGHT IS DERIVED, NOT PICKED: half of `.sbe-lvl-hit`'s 14px stroke, plus one,
// so the entire target lies inside the strip at every height the share table
// can produce — 37px at the floor included. Unity still means "the top of the
// scale", which was built deliberately and is not what he asked to change; it
// simply no longer means "the top pixel of the box".

// `sbeLayout` re-derives the film position of every clip from the running
// total of the lead gaps — the PICTURE's position and nothing else. So a right
// trim, a move, a ripple delete, an insert or a reorder slid every clip after
// it while every unlinked strip stood still, and a J-cut the user had placed
// three shots earlier silently came apart:
//
//   "instead of allowing me to remove or move what video is visible while
//    leaving the sound intact and then rematching it, it is actually getting
//    the audio out of sync."
//
// A ripple is a RIGID TRANSLATION of everything downstream, so the sound rides
// with it — that is what keeps a pair in sync through an edit made somewhere
// else. The clip the gesture is actually ON is exempt: moving a picture off
// its own sound is the whole point of the feature, and `sbeAudioEdit` is the
// only other thing allowed to write the strip's position.
// WHAT IS RECORDED IS THE ANCHOR, not the film position: `film_start - start`
// is the film second at which this take's source zero would play, and it is
// the only number a sound has to follow. A ripple changes it by the whole
// translation; a head trim moves the slot and the in-point together and does
// not change it at all, which is exactly why a trim must leave the strip
// alone while a ripple must not.

// ---- THE STRIP PLAYER'S MODEL -------------------------------------------

// transport plays ONE <video> at a time and enters each clip at its picture
// boundary, so a clip's sound always landed with its picture no matter where
// its strip sat. The whole J/L-cut feature was inaudible — correct on disk,
// correct in the render's concat lanes, correct in the NLE export, and
// missing from the one place the user checks his work:
//
//   "I wanted it a little before her showing up, and I cut it that way. But
//    no matter what I do, this is always out."
//
// WHO OWNS A CLIP'S SOUND. Exactly one of the two, never both, or the same
// seconds play twice. The picture element keeps it when the strip IS the
// picture — that is every ordinary clip, and it costs nothing. The moment a
// strip exists in its own right, the player takes it.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A 16:9 pair at the asked-for 40/60 needs 2.96 px of width for every px of
// height. No window this panel runs in has that much of both: measured at
// 1440x900, the cut column is 1110px wide and has ~307px of height to spare,
// and 307px of height buys a pair 886px wide. The other 224px is the rail —
// the inspector and the unplaced strip, moved out of the vertical stack and
// into the space the monitors cannot reach. That is what makes "fill the
// width" true instead of aspirational.
//
//   * Height first: the monitors get the whole vertical budget, because
//     height is the scarce thing and a bigger picture is what was asked for.
//   * Then the rail gets what the pair leaves, clamped. If the leftover is
//     wider than the clamp, the SOURCE widens toward the program — up to
//     equal monitors and no further, since the program is the one being cut.
//   * If the width runs out first (a tall, narrow window), the pair takes the
//     width-derived height at exactly 40/60 and the leftover HEIGHT goes to
//     the timeline, which is the row that grows.
