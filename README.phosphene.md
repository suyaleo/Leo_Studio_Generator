> **Current release: v4.15.1.** **The install fixes.** ffmpeg is found where Pinokio actually puts it, so a render that finished no longer fails to export. A **half-built engine environment** is caught at boot with a one-click repair instead of failing 30 seconds into every render. **Hailuo H3 checks its MLX before it starts** rather than dying eight minutes in. Captioning tells you when it was pointed at LTX-2.5's text encoder instead of the vision model. Under the hood, the panel now reports **which step of getting started failed** — because 55% of new installs never render and nothing said why. See [what is collected](docs/ANALYTICS.md). Full notes on the [releases page](https://github.com/mrbizarro/Phosphene/releases).

## Overview

Phosphene is a local generative-media panel for Apple Silicon. It runs **two video engines as peers** — [LTX-Video 2.5](https://github.com/Lightricks/LTX-Video) (MLX port) and [Hailuo H3](https://github.com/MiniMax-AI) (MiniMax-H3 FL2VA) — both doing joint audio-and-video synthesis, plus [Qwen-Image-Edit-2509](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit-2509) (with a Lightning 4-step fast tier) for stills, and an in-panel LoRA training pipeline for character identity (face + voice from a single dataset). Everything runs on-device: no cloud, no API keys, and no prompt, image, video or filename ever leaves your Mac. It does send anonymous usage counts (version, hardware class, render stats) — every field is listed in [docs/ANALYTICS.md](docs/ANALYTICS.md), and one click in Settings turns it off.

3.0 introduces in-panel character training (face + voice LoRA from one dataset), the Audio-to-Video workflow, the Image Studio tab, hardware capability tiering, and an agentic prompt enhancer driven by the same local Gemma 3 12B used for auto-captioning.

A 7-second character clip with synced audio renders in roughly 6 minutes on an M4 Max 64 GB. The delivered file is **1280×720 HD** after the built-in 2× upscale; clips are generated at 1024×576 internally and upscaled before mux. Voice + face LoRAs from a 50-image dataset finish in ~3 hours on the same hardware.

The interface adapts to the machine it runs on. Under 48 GB of unified memory, the panel exposes only what fits in that envelope (text-to-video, image-to-video, and the Image tab). At 48 GB and above, character mode, first/last-frame keyframing, clip extension, and the Q8 HQ pipelines become available. Tier detection runs once at boot and the unsupported surfaces are hidden rather than greyed out.

## Engines

LTX, Hailuo H3 and YuE2 are peers with their own jobs and install sizes:

| Engine | Surface | Weights | Unified memory |
|---|---|---|---|
| **LTX-Video 2.5** | Video, including Audio → Video | ~27.5 GB base; Q8 adds ~37 GB | Adapts to the Mac; advanced modes need more memory |
| **Hailuo H3** | Video with dialogue and sound | ~75 GB; Q8 DiT adds ~22 GB | 36 GB+ with the Q8 DiT; 60 GB+ for full bf16 |
| **YuE2** | Audio → Compose: vocals and arrangement from lyrics and a style | ~11 GB | 24 GB or more |

YuE2 installs from inside the panel: open **Audio → Compose** and click **Install music engine (YuE2, ~11 GB)** (the Pinokio sidebar entry **Install the music engine** does the same).
Compose offers section-tagged lyrics, a prose style, an Instrumental pill,
three score modes, Draft/Final quality and a maximum length. Songs appear as
48 kHz stereo WAVs in the gallery; **Drive video** loads a song into the video
workflow without submitting it. Until the music pack is installed, Audio
keeps its existing layout. [Music engine guide](docs/MUSIC_ENGINE.md).

YuE2 weights use [CC BY-NC 4.0 plus individual-creator permission](LICENSES/YuE2-MODEL_LICENSE.txt):
creators may monetize their songs; companies need a license for the weights.
Code is Apache-2.0. Generated with YuE2 by Multimodal Art Projection · MLX port
by vanch007. On an M4 Max a 3-minute song renders in about 3 minutes (Final)
and a 2-minute Draft in about 1 minute, peaking at 11 GB of memory.

## Features

### Video
<img width="872" height="141" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8e6d839-0ef5-4310-8b83-4f0a76a58779" />


Text-to-video, image-to-video, and audio-to-video, all delivered as MP4 with joint audio (lip-sync, footsteps, ambience) in a single diffusion pass. Output is 1280×720 after the built-in 2× upscale. Character mode renders against the Q8 dev transformer with a fused character LoRA; the server-side validator refuses Q4 + character to prevent silent identity drift. First/last-frame keyframing and clip extension are available on the Q8 surface, with TeaCache wired through both.

**Two engines, one switcher.** A segmented control in the header picks which engine renders the shot, and the form below re-prices itself for whichever one is selected:

| | [**LTX-Video 2.5**](https://github.com/Lightricks/LTX-Video) | [**Hailuo H3**](https://github.com/MiniMax-AI) (MiniMax-H3 FL2VA) |
|---|---|---|
| **How you get it** | The base install (27.5 GB) | One click in the Pinokio sidebar (75 GB) |
| **Modes** | Text, image, keyframes, extend, audio-to-video, character | Text and image |
| **Character LoRAs** | Yes — trained in-panel, face + voice | Not yet |
| **Memory** | Every tier in the table above; the surface adapts | 64 GB class, or 48 GB with the Q8 DiT pack on disk |
| **Best at** | Breadth: every workflow the panel offers, plus your own trained faces | Dialogue: joint video + spoken lines + sound, from one prompt |
| **Weights licence** | [LTX-2.x Community License](LICENSES/LTX-2.x-Community-License.md) (Lightricks) | MiniMax Community License — territory restrictions apply |

Neither engine is a fallback for the other. If only one is installed, the other appears in the switcher as an offer with its size on it — one click explains what it does and where to get it, and nothing about your existing renders changes when it lands.

#### Remix — bring your own media

Three IC-LoRA tools live under the **Remix** pill in the mode bar. All three run on the Q4 distilled checkpoint, so none of them needs the Q8 pack.

| Tool | You give it | You get |
|---|---|---|
| **Motion Control** | a clip | a new render that copies its **motion, camera move, composition and pose** while your prompt repaints the subject and the scene |
| **Ingredients** | 2–8 reference images (a face, a prop, a location) | one clip that composes them |
| **Colorize** | a black-and-white or desaturated clip | the same clip in colour |

**Motion Control** is the official [`Lightricks/LTX-2.3-22b-IC-LoRA-Union-Control`](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-2.3-22b-IC-LoRA-Union-Control) adapter — public, un-gated, no token, fetched with the base install. Feed it an ordinary video; it reads raw RGB, so nothing has to be preprocessed. A pose, depth, canny or segmentation **sequence** works too and follows more tightly, but you have to bring your own — **Phosphene ships no preprocessor** that derives one from a normal clip. Full write-up, including what makes a good control clip and what changes on LTX-2.5: **[`docs/MOTION_CONTROL.md`](docs/MOTION_CONTROL.md)**.

### Image Studio
<img width="1920" height="843" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e2f52de-b34c-44cf-9283-df30c4079607" />


Qwen-Image-Edit (Lightning 4-step) is the default image engine. It handles instruction edits ("change the white jacket to red") and multi-subject composition with up to three reference images, generating four candidates per shot in seconds with the Lightning LoRA baked in. It's a one-click install; until it lands the panel renders stills on a lighter mflux model. Results drop cards into a unified gallery, each with an Animate button that pre-fills the I2V form with the source still.

### Train Character

<img width="877" height="864" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e0564d9-6912-4d99-a9b0-1f2a2b01453e" />



End-to-end LoRA training inside the panel. The dataset uploader accepts 15 to 500 images per character. Captions are written by a local Gemma 3 12B (MLX, 4-bit) in roughly 90 seconds for a 37-image dataset, in the `[VISUAL]: <trigger>, <description>` format the LTX trainer expects. The default recipe is rank 32, alpha 32, 100 epochs, lr 1e-4, 512 px resolution, letterbox crop; total step count auto-scales with the dataset (e.g. 50 images → 5000 steps, 100 images → 10000 steps) so adding photos doesn't shift the trained-epochs target. Power users can override any of those in an advanced section. Optional voice LoRA from the same training run.

**Training needs 64 GB, and the panel does not refuse below it — it quietly trains something smaller.** Full 512 px LTX LoRA training materialises backward activations for the dev transformer, and a 48 GB Mac falls into swap thrash and never finishes. So on any Mac with **under 64 GB of unified memory** the panel rewrites all three presets in place: Quick becomes rank 4 / 384 px / 120 steps, Medium rank 8 / 384 px / 300 steps, and **High becomes rank 8 / 448 px / 500 steps** — with the advanced overrides clamped to match, so you cannot ask for the full recipe and get it. The preset names on screen do not change.

Be clear about what that means. **rank 32 is the only recipe anyone has graded for identity.** Below it the training finishes, writes a valid file, loads without a warning, and may simply not move the model. The panel measures that now: every trained LoRA is checked for how much it actually changed, a weak one finishes with a warning instead of a bare "done", and the verdict follows the file into the library so you find out before you spend a render. Quick and Medium say *"identity ungraded"* on their own pills for the same reason. If you are on a sub-64 GB Mac, read a weak verdict as *this hardware, this recipe* — not as a problem with your photos.

<img width="871" height="640" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a25bfc78-671e-4972-bf51-231ae5f5cc04" />

The Train tab also exposes **Style** training (experimental in v3.0) — same end-to-end pipeline, different intent: a curated set of movie frames teaches the model an aesthetic (color grading, lighting, composition) rather than an identity. The trained style LoRA stacks with character LoRAs at render time. Lightly validated as of v3.0; please report rough edges via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/mrbizarro/phosphene/issues).

### Audio-to-Video
<img width="876" height="557" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e64b2a23-e3e2-4132-8ceb-838b0c089136" />

New workflow tab in 3.0. WAV or MP3 in, MP4 out — the audio drives motion in the generated video, and an optional reference image anchors frame zero. The pipeline runs in two stages: low-resolution with classifier-free guidance, then full-resolution with the distilled LoRA fused on top. The original input audio is muxed onto the final clip so the result is a single self-contained MP4. Requires Q8 + ≥64 GB unified memory.

### LoRAs

Drop `.safetensors` into `mlx_models/loras/` for immediate use, or browse and install LTX LoRAs from CivitAI inside the panel (per-row rename, download, companion-aware delete). Character bundles live alongside style LoRAs and are filtered out of the regular picker so they don't show up twice.

**MiniMax H3 LoRAs use a separate library.** Switch the Video engine to
**Hailuo H3** and the LoRAs panel gains an **Import H3 LoRA** button: pick a
`.safetensors` and the panel checks it against your installed H3 transformer
before it ever appears in the picker. You can still drop files into
`mlx_models/hailuo-h3/loras/` by hand and press Rescan — same checks, same
result. H3 accepts the runner layout with paired `lora_A` / `lora_B` tensors
and lets you choose its strength in the picker. ComfyUI repacks are handled
automatically: the `diffusion_model.` namespace is stripped in a header-only
rewrite that leaves every tensor byte-identical. A raw Kohya file
(`lora_down`, `lora_up`, and `.alpha`) is deliberately rejected: renaming it
would ignore its required alpha/rank scaling. Where the adapter states a scale
the H3 runner cannot apply on its own, the import records it as the row's
recommended strength instead of refusing the file. The H3 CivitAI filter also
routes compatible downloads to this library; H3 uses one adapter at a time. If
Turbo is selected, turn it off or choose **My LoRA** in the Adapter control to
spend that slot on your custom LoRA for the render.

### HTTP API

Everything the panel does is reachable over plain HTTP on `127.0.0.1:8198`. Queue video jobs, generate images, train characters, manage LoRAs, poll status, fetch outputs — all from `curl`, a Python script, or an external agent like Claude Code or Codex. The panel UI is just one client; nothing about the feature set is exclusive to it.

```bash
# Queue a text-to-video render with a character LoRA stacked on a style LoRA.
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8198/queue/add \
  --data-urlencode "mode=t2v" \
  --data-urlencode "prompt=Cinematic close-up of bizarrotrn man in a wood-paneled study, golden hour" \
  --data-urlencode "width=1024" --data-urlencode "height=576" \
  --data-urlencode "frames=169" --data-urlencode "quality=high" \
  --data-urlencode 'loras=[{"path":"mlx_models/loras/bizarrotrn_v2.safetensors","strength":1.0}]'
# → {"ok": true, "id": "j-..."}
```

Endpoints cover the full lifecycle: `POST /queue/add` and `/run` for video, `POST /image/generate` for stills, `POST /train/start` for LoRA training, `POST /upload` for reference images and audio, `POST /characters/<id>/generate` for one-shot character renders, `POST /loras/refresh` and the CivitAI download endpoints for LoRA management, `GET /status` for queue and system state, `GET /outputs` for the gallery, `POST /queue/retry` / `/queue/remove` / `/queue/pause` / `/stop` for queue control. JSON in, JSON out, form-encoded POST bodies for the heavy endpoints. No auth — bound to loopback only.

Full reference with every field, every default, and copy-pasteable `curl` invocations: **[docs/API.md](docs/API.md)**. Notable uses: batch overnight render runs, IDE integrations, custom front-ends, and external agents that orchestrate Phosphene as a tool. The in-panel chat was retired in v3.0 — its replacement is your own agent talking to this API.

## Hardware

Apple Silicon only. MLX is Apple-only by design.

| RAM | Tier | What runs |
|---|---|---|
| Under 48 GB | Compact (Q4 surface) | Text and image-to-video at smaller sizes. Image tab works. FFLF, Extend and High are hidden — they need more memory than this tier has. |
| 48 to 79 GB | Comfortable (Q8 surface) | The canonical tier, built on M4 Max 64 GB. Everything works. FFLF and Extend capped at 768 px long side. |
| 80 to 119 GB | Roomy | Most modes at full size. FFLF and Extend up to 1024 px. |
| 120 GB+ | Studio | No size limits. |

Working-memory footprint is non-negotiable: standard 1280×704 generation peaks at roughly 22 GiB resident, and HQ with the Q8 dev transformer at roughly 38 GiB. Tier is detected once at boot from RAM and exposed to the UI via `body[data-cap-tier="q4|q8"]`. Set `LTX_FORCE_CAP_TIER=q4` to preview the Compact surface from a higher-tier machine.

**RAM is not the only gate, and on LTX-2.5 it is not the interesting one.** The table above answers "what can this Mac's memory serve". Whether trained **characters** render faithfully, and whether the **High** tier exists at all, are questions about which weight packs are on disk — a 64 GB Mac holding only the base pack is Comfortable-tier and still cannot do either. The panel tracks that separately (`body[data-q8-pack]`), and every surface that offers a download says which pack and how big.

## Install

### Via Pinokio (recommended)

1. Install [Pinokio](https://pinokio.computer).
2. In Pinokio: **Discover** -> **Download from URL** -> paste `https://github.com/mrbizarro/phosphene`.
3. Click **Install**.
4. Click **Start** -> **Open Panel** -> http://127.0.0.1:8198.

Pinokio handles the hardware gate, the vendored `ltx-2-mlx` clone at its pinned tag, the uv-managed Python 3.11 venv, the runtime patches, and the model download.

**What a fresh install fetches (~37 GB):** LTX-2.5's engine (20.74 GB) and its Gemma 4 text encoder (6.73 GB) — the generation the panel renders with — plus the 22 MB live-preview decoder; Gemma 3 (~6 GB), which is what **Enhance** and the **Storyboard planner** run on; and three control LoRAs (~4 GB) for the **Colorize**, **Ingredients** and **Motion Control** modes — all three public and un-gated, no token needed. Every step is resumable. (**HDR** uses a fourth, *gated* LoRA — that one needs a Hugging Face token in Settings, and the panel fetches it on first use.)

**LTX-2.3 is not downloaded.** It is needed only to *train* a character — the trainer runs against 2.3, not 2.5 — so the panel offers it (~20 GB, plus the ~21 GB full-precision dev transformer) the moment you open the **Train Character** tab, and in **Settings → Models** any time. The three control LoRAs are 2.3-trained, and Lightricks has published exactly one LTX-2.5 IC-LoRA to date (a pixel spatial upscaler): **Ingredients** is therefore refused on 2.5 with the reason, and **Motion Control** still transfers the motion but loses most of the prompt's grip on the new subject — see [`docs/MOTION_CONTROL.md`](docs/MOTION_CONTROL.md). Everything else renders on LTX-2.5.

For trained characters and voices, install the **LTX-2.5 Q8 weights** (30.02 GB) from **Settings → Models**. The **High** tier additionally needs the **High add-on** (29.50 GB), which installs into the same folder.

If you have a Hugging Face token, paste it under **Settings** in the panel. Downloads run roughly 10x faster, and the same token unlocks the one gated LoRA (HDR). **Motion Control does not need it** — the Union Control weight is public.

About the version pins: `mlx 0.31.2` attenuates the LTX vocoder by 22 dB. Stay on 0.31.1. `ltx-2-mlx` is pinned to the fork **tag** `v0.14.19+ltx25.6` (`mrbizarro/ltx-2-mlx`, commit `0b74258`) — v0.14.19 plus the LTX-2.5 port, because upstream has no 2.5 branch. A tag, not a bare SHA: a force-push upstream would strand every install with an un-fetchable pin and a dead Update button. The installed packages report `0.14.19+ltx25.6` and `_LTX_EXPECTED_VERSION` must match that string exactly, or every render logs a VERSION SKEW warning. `scripts/pinokio/ltx_checkout.sh` holds the pin and `node scripts/check_ltx_pin.js` enforces the agreement. `mflux 0.18.0` is the version `patch_mflux_fbcache.py` is line-targeted against, and it is pinned TOGETHER with mlx — mflux declares its own mlx range, so installing it with deps after pinning mlx can silently move mlx (`node scripts/check_post_update.js` fails if either moves alone). `hatchling<1.32` (in `pip-build-constraints.txt`) is a *build-time* pin: 1.32 rejects the `readme = "../../README.md"` that all three upstream packages declare, which fails the wheel build on every tag.

## Interface

Workflow tabs at the top of the panel: Video, Images, Storyboard, Audio, Train Character. Each is a single page; the helper subprocess and model state persist across tab switches.

Prompting notes:

- Video / text mode: describe sound the same way you describe scene; the audio path reads the same prompt as the visual.
- Video / image mode: prompt with motion beats rather than describing the still. Roughly one beat per 2–3 seconds of clip length.
- Video / character mode: select an avatar from the picker, include the trigger word in the prompt. Q8 Draft (736×416) for iteration, Q8 Pro (1024×576 → 1280×720 final) for delivery.
- Images: zero to three reference slots. Empty zone is text-to-image. Qwen-Image-Edit instructions are read literally — "change the white jacket to red" preserves the rest of the scene.
- Train Character: center crop for tight portraits, letterbox for wide-shot proportions. The default preset (rank 32, alpha 32, 100 epochs, lr 1e-4) is validated end-to-end and recommended as the starting point.

## Migrating from 2.0

Quit Pinokio (or the panel terminal), then click Update, then Start. Renders, settings, queue, models, and LoRAs all persist across the upgrade via Pinokio's `fs.link` persistent drive. The first update takes a few minutes.

> Stragglers note: a few very old v2.x installs once had to click Update twice (Pinokio ran the stale on-disk `update.js` before pulling the new one). The update script now force-reinstalls the changed packages, so a single Update is enough. If a v2.x install still boots to dependency errors, click Update once more.

Behavioral changes worth noting in 3.0:

- Character is a first-class mode pill on the Video tab, no longer a chip nested inside T2V.
- Q8 HQ is the default quality for character renders. The server-side validator rejects Q4 + character combinations to prevent identity-degraded output.
- TeaCache is wired through both Extend and Audio-to-Video stage 1.
- Vertical-player chrome is positioned outside the right edge so 9:16 clips are no longer occluded by controls.
- Training presets now scale step count by `epochs × image_count`. The 100-epoch "high" preset that produced the validated v2 LoRAs preserves its shape regardless of dataset size.

## What's in the repo

- `mlx_ltx_panel.py` is the panel HTTP server: worker thread, helper subprocess management, engine registry, capability tier detection. The HTTP route handlers live in `panel/routes_*.py` (registered into route tables — one claim per route, enforced), and the frontend is plain files under `webapp/` (`index.html`, twelve ES modules in `webapp/js/`, `webapp/style/panel.css`) served from disk. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` is the map: what lives where, how the halves talk, and where a new feature's code goes.
- `mlx_warm_helper.py` is the long-running inference subprocess. Holds T2V, I2V, Extend, HQ, and Keyframe pipelines. Reads job specs from stdin, emits events to stdout.
- `image_engine.py` dispatches the Image tab. Backends `hidream`, `mflux`, `mock`. Each spawns its own subprocess with `start_new_session=True` so `/stop` kills the whole tree.
- `patch_ltx_codec.py` applies one idempotent runtime patch: lossless H.264 output (yuv444p). As of the v0.14.8 pin the memory-frees, VAE streaming, Metal-watchdog and frame_rate patches are all native upstream; the v0.14.19 pin keeps that shape — one edit, one line.
- `lora_lab/` is vendored from the [`lora-lab`](https://github.com/mrbizarro/lora-lab) authoring tree. Training works out of the box; set `LTX_LORA_LAB_ROOT` to iterate against an external clone.
- `mlx_models/` and `mlx_outputs/` both persist across Pinokio Reset via fs.link.

`image_engine.py` also carries a `hidream` backend (8B Qwen3-VL backbone, unified pixel-patch transformer) for photoreal stills. It is **hidden in the UI since v3.0.3** ([#15](https://github.com/mrbizarro/phosphene/issues/15)) and not installed by default — it lives in a separate lab repo you clone manually into `$HIDREAM_LAB_DIR` (see Manual install, step 7) and is loaded on demand.

What Phosphene adds on top of those: a persistent batch queue, a warm helper subprocess with capability-tier feature gating, lossless H.264 output with JSON sidecars, the in-panel character + voice LoRA training pipeline, the Image tab dispatch layer with adaptive wall-time estimates, the local Gemma 3 prompt-enhancer, and the Pinokio install + update lifecycle scripts.

## Roadmap

Upcoming work — three-aspect character LoRAs, scene/room LoRAs for
location continuity across clips, a real multi-character workflow,
and stacking-aware strength balance — is tracked in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).
Contributors and feature requests welcome via GitHub Issues.

## Support development

## Network note

Phosphene renders locally — no prompt, model input or output is ever uploaded. A clean production install makes three kinds of outbound request, and no others: it checks GitHub every 30 minutes for an update badge (disable with `PHOSPHENE_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK=1`); it touches Hugging Face or CivitAI when you download models or LoRAs; and it sends anonymous usage counts — one event per panel start and one per finished render, carrying the panel version, a hardware class such as `M4 Max / 64 GB`, and render stats like engine, tier and a bucketed duration. Never content of any kind.

That last one is **on by default and the build ships a working key**, so a fresh clone does report. Every event and field is specified in [docs/ANALYTICS.md](docs/ANALYTICS.md), mirrored in plain text to `state/usage-log.jsonl` so you can read exactly what was sent, and switched off in one click in Settings → *Anonymous usage analytics* (or with `PHOSPHENE_ANALYTICS_DISABLED=1`).

The panel binds to `127.0.0.1` with no auth. It's not designed for LAN exposure or tunneling.
